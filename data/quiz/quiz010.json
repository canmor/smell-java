  "explanation": "This example shows three classes (EmailNotifier, SMSAlertSystem, and PushNotificationManager) that perform similar functions (sending notifications) but have different interfaces. These classes should be unified under a common interface, such as creating an INotifier interface that all notification classes implement, which would improve code consistency and allow client code to handle different types of notifications polymorphically."
