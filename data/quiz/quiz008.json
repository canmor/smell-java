  "explanation": "This class has several fields (discountPercentage, isHolidaySeason, seasonalBonus, appliedPromotions) that are only used under specific conditions (end-of-season promotions), and are meaningless the rest of the time. This is the temporary field smell, and these fields and related logic should be extracted into a dedicated class (like SeasonalDiscountCalculator)."
