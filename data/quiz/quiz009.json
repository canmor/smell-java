  "explanation": "This example demonstrates the refused bequest code smell, where the ElectricBicycle class inherits from the Vehicle class but refuses multiple inherited methods (startEngine, stopEngine, refuel, changeGear). This indicates that the inheritance relationship may be inappropriate, and composition should be considered instead of inheritance, or the class hierarchy should be redesigned with more suitable abstractions (such as creating a Bicycle base class for ElectricBicycle to inherit from)."
