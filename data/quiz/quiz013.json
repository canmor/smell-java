  "explanation": "This example is filled with excessive and unnecessary comments that explain obvious code logic (such as explaining 'inventory is sufficient, return true'). Good code should be self-explanatory, reducing the need for comments through meaningful naming and clear structure. Excessive comments often indicate that the code itself lacks clarity or has poor design."
