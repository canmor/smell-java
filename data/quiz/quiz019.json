  "explanation": "This example demonstrates the inappropriate intimacy code smell, where multiple classes (CourseManager, GradeCalculator, SchoolReport) directly access and manipulate the package-private fields of the Student class. The Student class exposes its internal data structure (name, id, grades) as package-private fields, allowing other classes to directly modify these fields. This breaks encapsulation and creates tight coupling between classes. A better approach would be to make these fields private and provide appropriate public methods in the Student class to safely manipulate this data."
